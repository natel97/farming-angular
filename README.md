# Farming

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## What is this?
Honestly, I don't really know! Haha!
So pretty much, just drag and drop stuff on other stuff until it magically grows and stuff. Feeling like a cheater/hacker? Type 
```javascript
window["Give Me MONEY!!!"](**Amount to give goes here**)
```
into the console to get you some quick cash!

## What's the point?
I'm still trying to figure that one out.


## Wanna see this app in action?
See it [here](http://nate-farm.herokuapp.com)

## But WHY?
To cause confusion and chaos throughout the masses. MWAHAHAHA jk. Nah, it's just an opportunity to play with Angular and see what it's made of because I can.
